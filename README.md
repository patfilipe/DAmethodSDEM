# Estimation of Stochatic Differential Equations mixed models using the Delta method approximaion

R code to estimate modle parameters of stochastic differential usind the Stochastic Gompertz model. The method is able to estimates the cases:
## 1) The fixed effects closed formula
## 2) The delta approximation method for random alpha case
## 3) The delta approximation method for random beta case 
## 4) The delta approximation method both alpha and beta random
